Steady-state diffusion solution of the 2D C5G7 neutron transport benchmark (https://www.oecd-nea.org/upload/docs/application/pdf/2019-12/nsc-doc2005-16.pdf).

All code implemented in MATLAB using PDE Toolbox functionality. The idea of using the PDE Toolbox to solve neutron diffusion problems was originally documented by Dr. Xue Yang (https://www.ans.org/pubs/transactions/article-45297/).
