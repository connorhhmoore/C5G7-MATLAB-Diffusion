Steady-state diffusion solution of the 2D C5G7 neutron transport benchmark (https://www.oecd-nea.org/jcms/pl_32145/deterministic-time-dependent-neutron-transport-benchmark-without-spatial-homogenisation-c5g7-td).

All code implemented in MATLAB using PDE Toolbox functionality. The idea of using the PDE Toolbox to solve neutron diffusion problems was proposed by Dr. Xue Yang (https://www.ans.org/pubs/transactions/article-45297/).
